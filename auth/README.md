# Auth API module for MarshMallows

MarshMallows Auth is an API service which allows users to use the platform. It is required a person or service that acts as administrator. Users will not be able to register themselves in the platform, since an invitation is required. The administrator is the one in charge of managing those invitations.

## Routes

**/ (GET)**: System check. It will return `{ status: 'ok', version: x.x.x }` if everything is working.

**/registration (POST)** Accepts token and username as params. If the token is found in a user and it have not expired, this endpoint will respond with the information needed for the browser to request a webauthn registration. It also updates the user's username

**/registration/callback (POST)** After the webauthn action has been performed, this endpoint will receive the data generated and will save it as a "Key" assigned to a user. It also remove the registration token from the user if the key is saved.

**/login (POST)** Accepts an username. Will respond with the data necessary to perform a webauthn login for that specific user.

**/login/callback (POST)** After the webauthn action has been performed, this endpoint will check that the data from the key is correct and if it is from a key that the user owns. If everything is correct, it returns an "OK", and the user should be considered logged.
